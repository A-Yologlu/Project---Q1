# 🧩 Project – Q1: Programming Basics in C

This project summarizes what I learned during the first quarter of my Applied Computer Science studies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.  
It combines the main topics from the first 7 weeks — including string manipulation, arrays, functions, and sorting algorithms — into one complete C program.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To create a functional and well-structured C program that:
- Reads multiple strings from the user
- Stores them in an array
- Analyzes each string (for example, counts vowels or checks for duplicates)
- Sorts or modifies the strings using custom-made functions
- Displays clear and formatted results

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Functions and header files (`functions.c` and `functions.h`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Arrays and string arrays
- Pointers (basic understanding)
- String manipulation (`strlen`, custom string functions)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort / selection sort)
- Modular programming and code organization
