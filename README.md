# 🧩 Project – Q1: Programming Basics in C

This project summarizes what I learned during the first quarter of my Applied Computer Science studies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.  
It combines the main topics from the first 7 weeks — including string manipulation, arrays, functions, and sorting algorithms — into one complete C program.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To create a functional and well-structured C program that analyzes each sentence for:
- Number of vowels
- Number of consonants
- Number of words
- Average word length
- Whether it contains only whitespace

Then displays:
- The sentence with the most vowels
- The sentence with the fewest vowels
- The longest and shortest sentence
- The alphabetically first and last sentence

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Functions and header files (`functions.c` and `functions.h`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Arrays and string arrays
- String manipulation (`strlen`, custom string functions)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort / selection sort)
- Modular programming and code organization
